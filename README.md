# [Government Confidence and Corruption Perception ML Model](https://github.com/maggieyung/ecornell-portfolio/blob/main/DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb)

## Overview
This was the final project I submitted for Break Through Tech's Machine Learning Foundations course, where I aimed to apply all the machine learning skills/techniques I learned from the course into building an end-to-end ML classification pipeline from a real-life, relevant dataset.
- A supervised regression machine learning model using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, and Sklearn, with the goal of predicting a numerical score for perceptions of corruption and confidence in national government, based on the World Happiness Report (WHR) dataset
- Implemented feature engineering and content-based filtering techniques, benchmarking multiple models; gradient boosting yielded the best performance with RMSE = 0.1129, R2 = 0.6179, and MAE = 0.0803
